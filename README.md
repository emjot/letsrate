## Instructions

### Install

Add the letsrate gem into your Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'letsrate', '~> 1.0.9'
```

### Generate

```
rails g letsrate User
```

The generator takes one argument which is the name of your existing user model UserModelName. This is necessary to bind the user and rating datas.
Also the generator copies necessary files (jquery raty plugin files, star icons and javascripts)

Example:

Suppose you will have a user model which name is User. You could generate one with the devise generator:

```
rails g devise:install
rails g devise user

rails g letsrate user # => user is the model generated by devise
```

This generator will create Rate and RatingCache models and link to your user model.

### Prepare

I suppose you have a car model

```
rails g model car name:string
```

You have to include the Letsrate::rateable concern in your car model and define its rating dimensions with the rateable_on class method.

```ruby
class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Letsrate::Rateable

  rateable_on "speed", "engine", "price"
end
```

Then you need to include the Letsrate::Rater concern in the user model.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Letsrate::Rater
end
```

### Using

There are two helper methods to render ratings:

 You can user the rating_for helper method to show the average rating for a given object and dimension.

```erb
<%# show.html.erb -> /cars/1 %>

Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed" %>
Engine : <%= rating_for @car, "engine" %>
Price : <%= rating_for @car, "price" %>
```

If you need to change the star number, you should use star option like below.

```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :star => 10 %>
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "engine", :star => 7 %>
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "price" %>
```

 You can use the user_rating_for helper method to show the star rating for a given user.

```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for_user @car, current_user, "speed", :star => 10 %>
```
